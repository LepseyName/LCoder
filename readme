LCoder can work in the console with or without
an interface if the program call was:
LCoder 'file_in' 'file_out' <'-c' coder or '-d' decoder> 'KEY'

If the output file is '0' when encoding,
then a default file (file_in + '.sec') will be created.

If the decoding 'file_out'= '0', name taken from the extension.
file_out = file_in - '.sec'
In case of a non-standard name,
the program will report an error and
prompt you to enter the file again

The KEY must be a multiple of 24 characters
and must be between 24 and 120 characters long

When encoding is possible to set the encoding level from 1 to 5.
When called from the command line, you can enter 1 to 5 instead 
of a 'KEY' to automatically generate the key
